Hello, my name is Marcos.
I’m currently a high school student learning Python, and I have a passion for technology and programming.
My goal is to pursue a degree in Software Engineering, as I’m fascinated by how software can solve real-world problems.
In addition to this, I’m also interested in cybersecurity and plan to explore this field further to understand how to protect systems and data from cyber threats.
I believe that combining these skills will allow me to contribute to innovative solutions in the tech industry.
